    - Early on worked to build some the web's first interactive mapping tools

## Business Activities

- **Problem Solved:**

- **Target Customers:** 
  
  Home sellers, buyers, landlords and renters.

- **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**

  <u>Some USP Points</u>:

  - Market integrations streamline key processes, e.g. a home loan or pre-approval through Bay Equity, which was acquired by Redfin in January 2022.[^4]

  - Sellers pay a 1% listing fee (as opposed to  2.5%) which includes marketing (e.g. photos, & 3D tour)

  - Offers on-demand home tours for buyers

- **Technologies Used:** 

  Redfin uses various technologies, including many 3rd-party website integrations (*see head tag section in website page source*).

- **Performance vs. Competitors:**

  Zillow FY2022[^9]: 

  | Year Ended December 31, | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | % Change | 2020 to 2021 % |
  |-------------------------|------|------|------|----------|---------------|

  | Gross profit | $1,591 | $1,809 | $1,369 |

  **Summary**:

  Zillow draws over 4x the average monthly visitors and over 5x the gross profit as Redfin. However, Redfin has greater overall revenue. A deeper-dive analysis would provide greater insights into the differences between business / financial models and long term strategy. 

## Recommendations

- **Suggested Product/Service:** 

1. Add a feature for verified home tourers to provide their value estimates, in addition observations
2. Stop practice of hiding historical sales and other listing/relisting data
3. Improve matching algorithms by adding more user preference field inputs
4. Make home value estimator and other private calculators open source
5. Share results of inspections

- **Benefits:**

1. It would help to democraticize the process by sourcing data from tourers
2. Other firms like Zillow share the data
3. Other platforms such as Zillow have a better search UI/UX and filters
4. By showing the math, consumers may be more engaged in the logic
5. Use inspection reports to reduce waste 

- **Technologies:** Redfin can implement these changes using their existing technology stack, e.g. JavaScript, Python and PostgreSQL.
