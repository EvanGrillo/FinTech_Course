# Redfin Case Study

## Overview and Origin

- **Company Name:** Redfin (anagram of the words "friend" and "finder")
- **Incorporation Date:** October 2002 (originally as Appliance Computing Inc), reincorporated in February 2005 in Delaware and changed name to Redfin Corporation in May 2006[^3]
- **Founders:**
    - David Eraker
    - Michael Dougherty
    - David Selinger
- **Idea for the Company:** 
    - David Eraker's personal experience buying and selling a house in Seattle highlighted the technological underdevelopment in the real estate market.
    - Founders aimed to shift the balance of power from agents (with powerful commission-driven incentives) towards consumers by leveraging data and technology to 'level the playing field'.
    - Filed patents for [Online marketplace for real estate transactions](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9105061B2/en) and [Web-based real estate mapping system](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9213461B2/en).
    - Early on worked to build some the web's first interactive mapping tools

- **Funding:** Redfin is a publicly traded company (since 2017) and has had 12 funding rounds totaling $319.6M. Their Series A round raised $770,000 from Madrona Venture Group in September 2005.[^5]

## Business Activities

- **Problem Solved:** Redfin aims to provide consumers with a seamless buying and selling experience through strategic market integrations and technology.

- **Target Customers:** Home sellers, buyers, landlords and renters.

- **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**
  Redfin's stated long-term goal is to integrate brokerage, rentals, mortgage, and title services into one solution, making consumer moves more efficient and cost-effective compared to standalone services.

  Redfin agents earn a salary, vs. a percentage-based commission and coordinate a team of specialists, e.g. a home loan or pre-approval through Bay Equity, which was acquired by Redfin in January 2022.[^4]

  Sellers pay a 1% listing fee (as opposed to  2.5%) which includes marketing (e.g. photos, & 3D tour) 

  On-demand home tours

- **Technologies Used:** Redfin uses various technologies, including many 3rd-party website integrations (*see [Index Page View Source](view-source:https://www.redfin.com/)*). Notable data and application technologies include JavaScript, Python, React.js, React Native, Node.js, NGINX, Redis, DynamoDB, Swift, Spring MVC, CentOS, AWS, Java, Android, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud, and Kafka.[^6]

3. Improve matching algorithms by adding more user preference field inputs
4. Make home value estimator and other private calculators open source
5. Share results of inspections

- **Benefits:**

1. It would help to democraticize the process by sourcing data from consumers engaged
2. Other firms like Zillow share the data
3. Other platforms such as Zillow have a better search UI/UX and filters
4. By showing the math, consumers may be more engaged in the logic
